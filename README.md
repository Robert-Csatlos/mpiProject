# mpiProject
The files used for the MPI Project SAT algorithms analysis.

---PEREQUISITES---

To run these programs you first need:
dd and psutil


How to install?

Write these two commands in your terminal:

pip install dd

pip install psutil

---HOW TO USE---

There are 4 folders, each with the corresponding algorithm.
To test the algorithm specified in the folder, make sure that the only .py file in the folder is the one you want to test.
Run the .py file using the terminal, VS-Code or the preffered IDE.
Write (numbers only) how many time you want to repeat the algorithm in the session as "instances"
Check the output.txt file for the output and the stats.txt file for the run-time and ram.


---DISCLAIMER---

The test values made on other devices might be different from the values that I got in the paper, since the PC's might have other components.
